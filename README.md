Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from a retail company to understand customer behavior, identify trends, and improve business strategies. The analysis is structured into several key steps, including data cleaning, exploration, clustering, and classification.

Key Components
Data Understanding:
Dataset Description: The dataset contains transaction records with various attributes such as invoice number, product description, quantity sold, unit price, customer ID, and country.
Objective: Understand the structure and content of the dataset to inform subsequent analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values: Identify and address any missing data to ensure the integrity of the analysis.
Removing Duplicates: Check for and eliminate duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure that data types are appropriate for analysis (e.g., converting dates to datetime format).
Data Exploration:
Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of key variables.
Visualizations: Create visual representations (e.g., histograms, bar charts) to identify trends and patterns in the data, such as sales by country and top-selling products.
Data Visualization:
Sales Trends: Analyze sales over time to identify peak periods and trends.
Product Performance: Visualize the performance of different products to inform inventory and marketing strategies.
Clustering:
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features (e.g., quantity and unit price) for clustering analysis.
Clustering Algorithm: Apply algorithms like K-Means to group similar transactions or customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Evaluation: Use metrics like the Silhouette Score to assess the quality of the clusters formed.
Classification:
Label Creation: Use the results from clustering to create labels for classification tasks.
Model Training: Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict customer segments or behaviors based on the labeled data.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and F1-Score to ensure it performs well on unseen data.
Insights and Recommendations:
Key Findings: Summarize the insights gained from the analysis, such as customer preferences and sales trends.
Business Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis, such as targeted marketing strategies or inventory management improvements.
Documentation:
Reporting: Compile the findings, methodologies, and recommendations into a structured report or presentation for stakeholders.
